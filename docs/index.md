# Mac Replacement Icons Expansion Pack

In December 2016 Ollin Boer Bohan ([github](https://github.com/madebyollin), [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/ollin)) released an eye candy, a mesmerizing collection of replacement icons for Mac OS -  [Mac Replacement Icons aka MRI](https://macreplacementicons.com). It was a wonderful Christmas gift I was secretly praying to get. Yet I did not expect that it would be released only to mark the end of that chapter of his activities. 

Being a sucker for beautiful icons and I love my computer looking great and vibrant, with vivid colors. I couldn't take it seeing my dock and the dashboard half-customized, and half-... less beautiful. Let's face it, It's a trend nowadays to make all round icons for everything, even though the guidelines recommend using round shapes for applications that imply browsing through some information, like photo/music/books libraries, internet browsers, and such.

As I had a luxury of not having to work last year due to a heavy work-related burnout, and the part of my brain that used to code was inaccessible I started playing around with Adobe Photoshop (no link needed I believe), [Pixelmator Pro](https://pixelmator.com/pro), [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com) and [Hue Shifter](https://bergdesign.com/hueshifter). 

I think I kinda got the basics and made some templates to produce icons in the style of the original MRI pack.

So far I have produces 78 icons, and there are more in the making.

As per this new year's resolution of mine to start publishing my works I try to do so at least once a week.

And so today I am proudly presenting the first part of the expansion pack - [the round icons, the "Browser"](part1). 
Go check them out, and let me know what you think.

They are not flawless, as I gained more experience I see how the early icons can be improved. 
But as a "recovering perfectionist" I think they are good enough to see the light of the day.
